      Keshav Smruti Pratishthan has a unique approach to education. Instead of focusing solely on
      slates, notebooks, and books, our concept is more similar to the ancient 'Gurukul' system of
      India. We aim to create not just students with good memory, but citizens with strong
      determination and physical fitness. Our goal is to blend education and culture in a scientific
      manner. This led to the establishment of Vivekanand Pratishthan in 1987.<br /><br />

      We now have a spacious two-story building situated on a 10-acre piece of land, approximately 7
      kilometers from the city. This location accommodates classes from Grade V to Grade X, with
      around 1000 students enrolled. Approximately 50 students come from nearby villages, while 700
      students come from the city. For the convenience of our city students, we provide
      transportation using 8 buses. This year, we introduced a hostel facility for 200 students.<br /><br />

      In the city, we offer pre-primary classes in the morning and primary classes (Grade I to Grade
      IV) in the afternoon. The school building here boasts a unique and attractive architectural
      design that is not commonly found in India. The surrounding gardens and greenery enhance the
      beauty of the campus. Across all sections of the institution, we have a total of 2200 students
      learning, supported by a staff of 150 teachers, including both teaching and non-teaching
      staff.<br /><br />

      In our city location, Keshav Smruti Pratishthan is involved in 11 projects, including Jalgaon
      Janta Sahakari Bank, Vivekanand Pratishthan, Matoshri Vruddhashram, Kshudha Shanti Zunaka
      Bhakar Kendra, Madhavrao Golavalkar Blood Bank, Eye-bank, Jalgaon Janta Infotech Private
      Limited, Ambulance Services, Ideal Village Projects, Deaf and Dumb School, and Balwant Credit
      Co-operative Society.<br /><br />
